A library for processing plain text corpora to various corpus formats.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, each NLP tool uses its own idiosyncratic input format. This library helps you to convert a corpus very easy to the desired format.

    It is called Forpus, because you are **for**\ matting a cor\ **pus**, but this is also a genus of parrot in the family Psittacidae.

This library supports **conversions** to

* `JSON <https://www.json.org/index.html>`_
* David Blei's `LDA-C <https://github.com/blei-lab/lda-c/blob/master/readme.txt>`_

See `Getting Started <www.google.de>`_ for how to install Forpus.
